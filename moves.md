# Moves in Podcasting
Before this class, I had never taken podcasts seriously. I thought they were simply glorified radio talk shows. However, since listening to two fictional narrative podcasts, my perspective has changed entirely. The podcasts, "Homecoming" series and "A Drop in the Ocean", blindsided my presumptions in extraordinarily good ways. I didn't want to miss a single beat of the story nor breath from the characters. I believe the "moves" listed below are just some of the tools that capture and retain an audience's attention.

## Squeezing out every last drop
There was not a time in either of the podcasts that went to waste. Every moment seemed to build off the previous in a deliberate and premeditated fashion. In the "Homecoming" series, even the quick, silent transitions seem to leave you teetering on a ledge, waiting for the next scene to begin so that you might regain your balance before falling from despair. "A Drop in the Ocean" demonstrated the same methods with, in my opinion, even more precision. Every shout, murmur, and whisper was properly placed in order the your whole body was paralyzed to know what would happen next.
