# Moves in Podcasting
Before this class, I had never taken podcasts seriously. I thought they were simply glorified radio talk shows. However, since listening to two fictional podcasts, my perspective has changed entirely. These podcasts, "Homecoming" series and "A Drop in the Ocean", blindsided my presumptions in extraordinarily good ways. I didn't want to miss a single beat of the story nor breath from the characters. I believe the "moves" listed below are just some of the tools that the directors implemented to capture and retain an audience's attention.

## Precious time
There wasn't a time in either of the podcasts that went to waste. Every moment seemed to build off the previous in a deliberate and premeditated fashion. In the "Homecoming" series, even the quick, silent transitions seem to leave you teetering on a ledge, waiting for the next scene to begin so that you might regain your balance before falling from despair. "A Drop in the Ocean" demonstrated the same methods with, in my opinion, even more precision. Every shout, murmur, and whisper was properly placed in order that your whole body might be paralyzed to know what would happen next.

## The power of imagination
Since podcasts contain no visuals, obviously, they must produce sights through a different medium: sound. The composed sounds fill each scene with surreal detail. Without these effects, podcasts would certainly be just talk shows. Here is a list of just some of the sound effects that helped present the scenes:
- The hubbub of airport traffic in the background (Homecoming)
- Gulping down the last sip and then slamming the glass onto the bar's wooden table (Homecoming)
- White noise of a dining hall (Homecoming)
- The repetitive squeak of a wheelchair (Homecoming)
- The creak of a submarine's interior (A Drop)
- The grunts of men struggling to hogtie one another (A Drop)
- Listening to Sonar (A Drop)
- Water bursting into the sub (A Drop)

As a mysterious thriller, "A Drop in the Ocean" seeks to keep its listeners on the edge of their seats. Accompanied by superb acting and an ingenious plot, the powerful sounds lead the listener to involuntarily fall into the podcast's purposeful trap: one's imagination. Once this begins, scenes of the story become more realistic and close, causing the listener to feel even more frightened.

## Significance of speech
A well-written script is vital to a podcast's success, especially for fictional stories like these two. What made these podcasts so great was the authenticity of the conversations. The characters were conversing realistically by awkwardly stumbling over words and accidentally talking over one another. Here are some critical  conversations from both podcasts:
- An assistant speaking with an angry boss on the telephone in a busy airport ("Homecoming")
- One-on-one therapy session with a recovering military client ("Homecoming")
- A newly promoted submarine captain calling his crew ("A Drop")
- Two men secretly scheming behind the captain's back ("A Drop")

Another important factor of podcasts is a character's tone of voice. Without being able to see any types of body language, actors have to portray emotions through not only what they say, but how they say it. In my opinion, this requires the actors to play their roles with vivacity, making podcasts more entertaining.
